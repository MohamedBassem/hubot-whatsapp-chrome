hubot-whatsapp-chrome
=====================

A Chrome extension that functions as a Hubot adapter for Whatsapp.

How to
------

 * Configure your Hubot to use the adapter `hubot-socket.io-adapter`
    * If you're not running your Hubot in localhost, change the URL in `background.js`
 * Install this repository as a Chrome extension ([how?](http://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system))
 * Open http://web.whatsapp.com in your browser and authenticate
 * Open the conversation you want Hubot to respond to
    * Note: DO NOT change conversations!
 * Click the extension button (it looks like a puzzle piece)
